# SmartsheetQRLabelMaker
If you use Smartsheet, have Excel, and happen to have a label printer then this may be of use to you.  This script takes identifying cells from a row and uses that information to create labels and generate QR codes.  You put the number of labels you want to create into a column named label then save the sheet.  Then you activate the script and it takes that number and makes that many sub rows and creates labels and QR codes for each.  Each sub row is marked with its corresponding number in the sequence.  If you are familiar with powershell and smartsheet you should be able to manipulate this script to work for you in the ways you want and then BOOM, you have a little product tracking system with Smartsheets built in bar code scanning function.  

The only slight problem I have with this script is the COM objects work differently in different environments and will occasionally ignore the $excel.visible = $false parameter which slows down the process a bit.
